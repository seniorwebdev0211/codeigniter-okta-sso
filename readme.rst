What is Okta SSO?
###################

The application relies on Okta SSO(Single Sign On) to serve as an external identity provider.
The Okta PHP SDK can be used in your server-side code to create and update users.

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
